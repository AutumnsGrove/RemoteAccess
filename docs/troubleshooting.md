# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and their solutions for your remote Mac mini workspace.

## üîå Connection Issues

### Problem: Can't connect to Mac mini via Termius

**Symptoms**: "Connection refused", "Host unreachable", or timeout errors

**Diagnosis checklist**:
1. Is Tailscale running on iPhone? (Check the app - should show green dot)
2. Is Tailscale running on Mac mini? (Check menu bar icon)
3. Is Mac mini powered on and connected to network?
4. Are you using the correct Tailscale IP?

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Verify Tailscale IP on Mac mini (need physical access or VNC)
tailscale ip -4

# Restart Tailscale on iPhone
# (Toggle off and on in the app)

# Test basic connectivity from iPhone Safari
http://100.x.x.x
# Should get SOME response (even "connection refused" means network works)

# Restart SSH on Mac mini (if you have access)
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
```

### Problem: Tailscale shows "Not connected"

**Symptoms**: Gray dot in Tailscale app, no devices visible

**Solutions**:

1. **Check internet connection**
   - Try Safari on iPhone
   - Check WiFi/cellular is working

2. **Re-authenticate Tailscale**
   - Open Tailscale app
   - Tap Settings ‚Üí Log out
   - Log back in
   - Toggle VPN on

3. **Restart device**
   - Sometimes iOS VPN profiles get stuck
   - Restart iPhone
   - Reopen Tailscale

4. **Check Tailscale status**
   - Visit https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines
   - Both devices should show "Connected"
   - If one shows "Offline", restart Tailscale on that device

## üñ•Ô∏è tmux Issues

### Problem: "tmux: command not found"

**Symptom**: Error when running tmux commands

**Solution**:

```bash
# Install tmux
brew install tmux

# Verify installation
which tmux
tmux -V
```

### Problem: Can't attach to session - "no server running"

**Symptom**: `tmux attach -t claude-code` returns error

**Solution**:

```bash
# Session doesn't exist - create it
tmux new -s claude-code

# Or check what sessions exist
tmux ls
```

### Problem: Attached to tmux but screen is frozen

**Symptoms**: Can't type, nothing happens, screen doesn't update

**Diagnosis**: Usually a process is hanging or waiting for input

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Try sending interrupt
Ctrl-C

# If that doesn't work, check if you're in copy mode
# Press 'q' to exit copy mode

# Force detach from session
Ctrl-a D  (capital D)

# If session is truly hung, kill it
tmux kill-session -t claude-code

# Create new session
tmux new -s claude-code
```

### Problem: Can't scroll in tmux

**Symptom**: Arrow keys don't scroll, output disappears off screen

**Solution**:

```bash
# Enter copy/scroll mode
Ctrl-a [

# Now use:
# - Arrow keys to move
# - Page Up/Down to jump
# - / to search
# - q to exit

# To enable mouse scrolling (add to ~/.tmux.conf):
set -g mouse on

# Reload config:
tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Problem: Lost session after Mac restart

**Symptom**: Mac restarted, can't find your tmux session

**Prevention**: tmux sessions don't survive restarts by default

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Install tmux-resurrect for session persistence
brew install tmux-resurrect

# Add to ~/.tmux.conf:
run-shell /opt/homebrew/opt/tmux-resurrect/share/tmux-resurrect/resurrect.tmux

# Save session: Ctrl-a Ctrl-s
# Restore session: Ctrl-a Ctrl-r
```

**Alternative**: Start Claude Code in a new session after restart

lsof -i :7681

# Verify Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4
```

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Start ttyd manually
ttyd -p 7681 bash

# Or restart launch agent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ttyd.terminal.plist
