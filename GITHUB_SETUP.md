# Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

Step-by-step guide to get this project on GitHub for your portfolio.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `remote-mac-workspace` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Secure remote development workspace with Tailscale, tmux, and mobile access"
4. Choose: **Public** (for portfolio visibility)
5. ✅ Add a README file: **NO** (we already have one)
6. ✅ Add .gitignore: **NO** (we already have one)
7. Choose a license: **NO** (we already have MIT)
8. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Local Git Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/remote-mac-workspace

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Verify what's being added (should NOT include any IPs, passwords, keys)
git status

# CRITICAL: Before committing, search for sensitive data
grep -r "100\." .  # Should not find any Tailscale IPs
grep -r "@" . | grep -v ".md" | grep -v "git"  # Check for emails/usernames

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Remote Mac mini workspace documentation"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/remote-mac-workspace.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What Gets Committed (✅ SAFE)

The following files are safe for public viewing:

- ✅ `README.md` - Project overview
- ✅ `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
- ✅ `PORTFOLIO.md` - Portfolio showcase document
- ✅ `LICENSE` - MIT license
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files
- ✅ `docs/*.md` - All documentation files
- ✅ `examples/*.template` - Template configuration files

## What Gets Ignored (🔒 PROTECTED)

The `.gitignore` file prevents these from being committed:

- 🔒 SSH keys (public and private)
- 🔒 Configuration files with real IPs
- 🔒 Screenshots
- 🔒 Log files
- 🔒 Temporary files
- 🔒 Environment files with secrets

## Security Checklist Before Pushing

Run these commands before every push:

```bash
# 1. Check for Tailscale IPs (100.x.x.x format)
git diff --cached | grep "100\."

# 2. Check for usernames/emails
git diff --cached | grep -i "username"
git diff --cached | grep "@"

# 3. Check for potential passwords
git diff --cached | grep -i "password"

# 4. View what will be committed
git diff --cached

# 5. If anything sensitive found, unstage it
git reset HEAD <filename>
```

## Making Your Personal Copy

Before committing, customize these files:

### 1. Update README.md
Replace or add:
- Your name
- Your project description
- Any custom features you added

### 2. Update LICENSE
Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name

### 3. Update PORTFOLIO.md
Add your own:
- Skills you want to highlight
- Additional projects that use this
- Your learning journey

### 4. Optional: Add a Blog Post
Create `blog-post.md` with your experience:
- Why you built this
- Challenges you faced
- What you learned
- How you use it daily

## Recommended Repository Structure

Your final GitHub repo should look like:

```
remote-mac-workspace/
├── .gitignore                    # Protects sensitive files
├── LICENSE                       # MIT License

├── QUICKSTART.md                 # Quick start guide
├── PORTFOLIO.md                  # Skills showcase
├── docs/                         # Detailed documentation
│   ├── setup-guide.md
│   ├── usage-guide.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   ├── troubleshooting.md
│   └── ttyd-setup.md
└── examples/                     # Template files
    ├── ssh_config.template
    └── ttyd-launch-agent.template.plist
```

## Enhancing Your Portfolio

### Add Topics/Tags to GitHub Repository

After pushing, on your GitHub repository:
1. Click "⚙️ Settings" or edit topics
2. Add relevant topics:
   - `remote-access`
   - `tmux`
   - `tailscale`
   - `vpn`
   - `ssh`
   - `system-administration`
   - `devops`
   - `mobile-development`
   - `ios`
   - `macos`
   - `automation`
   - `security`

### Create a Good README

Your README.md should have:
- ✅ Clear project description
- ✅ Visual architecture diagram (consider adding)
- ✅ Key features list
- ✅ Quick start instructions
- ✅ Link to detailed docs
- ✅ Screenshots (without sensitive info!)
- ✅ License badge

### Optional: Add Badges

Add to top of README.md:

```markdown
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macOS-lightgrey.svg)
![iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-compatible-green.svg)
```

### Optional: Add Screenshots

Take screenshots that show:
- Termius connected to Mac mini (blur any IPs!)
- tmux session running
- ttyd in Safari on iPhone (blur IPs!)
- VNC screen sharing (blur personal info!)

Save in `screenshots/` folder (which is gitignored), then:
1. Edit the screenshots to remove sensitive info
2. Move clean versions to `images/` folder
3. Reference in README.md

## Linking to Your Portfolio

### In Portfolio Website

Create a project card:
- **Title**: Remote Development Workspace
- **Tech**: Tailscale, tmux, SSH, VNC, macOS, iOS
- **Description**: Secure, mobile-accessible remote development environment
- **Link**: GitHub repository
- **Highlights**: Security-first design, comprehensive documentation, production-ready

## Ongoing Maintenance

### When to Update

Update your repository when you:
- Add new features
- Improve documentation
- Fix bugs
- Add new configuration examples
- Create helper scripts

### Commit Message Conventions

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples
git commit -m "docs: Add troubleshooting section for VNC issues"
git commit -m "feat: Add multi-session selector script"
git commit -m "fix: Update ttyd launch agent template for Apple Silicon"
git commit -m "docs: Improve security checklist in setup guide"

# Categories to use:
# docs: Documentation changes
# feat: New features
# fix: Bug fixes
# refactor: Code improvements
# chore: Maintenance tasks
```

### Keep .gitignore Updated

As you work, you might create new files. Update `.gitignore` if:
- Creating new types of sensitive files
- Adding new credentials
- Storing local-only configuration

## Advanced: GitHub Pages

Consider creating a GitHub Pages site:

1. Create `docs/` branch or use main branch
2. Settings → Pages → Enable
3. Create `index.html` or use README.md
4. Access at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/remote-mac-workspace`

This creates a public documentation website!

## Questions for Interviews

Be prepared to discuss:

1. **Why Tailscale over traditional VPN?**
   - Zero-configuration mesh network
   - Better security model (WireGuard)
   - No port forwarding needed
   - Device-level authentication

2. **How do you ensure security?**
   - Private network (Tailscale)
   - SSH key authentication
   - No public exposure
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Comprehensive .gitignore

3. **What would you do differently at scale?**
   - Add monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
   - Implement central logging
   - Use configuration management (Ansible)
   - Add automated testing
   - Container orchestration

4. **What was the hardest part?**
   - [Your honest answer about challenges you faced]
   - Shows problem-solving and learning
