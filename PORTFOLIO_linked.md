# Portfolio Showcase

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a production-ready remote development infrastructure setup. It showcases skills in system administration, network security, automation, and technical documentation.

## üí° Problem Statement

Modern development increasingly involves long-running AI-assisted tasks (Claude Code, code generation, automated testing) that need to:
- Run continuously without user presence
- Be monitored remotely from mobile devices
- Maintain state across disconnections
- Operate securely without exposing services to the public internet

**Challenge**: Design a system that enables "fire and forget" workflows while maintaining full observability and control from anywhere.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

### Key Technologies

1. **Tailscale** - WireGuard-based VPN for zero-trust networking
   - Eliminates need for port forwarding
   - Provides encrypted peer-to-peer connections
   - Enables secure access from any network

2. **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for persistent sessions
   - Maintains process state across disconnections
   - Enables long-running operations
   - Provides multi-window/pane workflows

3. **ttyd** - Web-based terminal
   - Browser-accessible terminal interface
   - Better mobile UX than traditional SSH clients
   - Enables multiple simultaneous connections

4. **SSH** - Secure shell access
   - Key-based authentication
   - Foundation for all remote access
   - Industry-standard security

5. **VNC** - Remote desktop protocol
   - Visual access to GUI applications
   - Verifies results of automated tasks
   - Debug visual rendering issues

### System Design

- Launch daemons/agents for service management
- Process supervision and automatic restart
- Log management and debugging

### Networking
- VPN configuration (Tailscale/WireGuard)
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Port management and service binding
- Firewall configuration (when needed)
- Understanding of OSI layers and tunneling protocols

### Security
- Public key cryptography implementation
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure credential management
- Network segmentation
- Avoiding exposure of internal services

### Automation
- Shell scripting (bash/zsh)
- Launch agent automation (launchd)
- Session management automation
- Config file templating
- Idempotent setup procedures

### Documentation
- Comprehensive setup guides
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Configuration management
- User-focused technical writing
- Clear visual diagrams

### DevOps Practices
- Infrastructure as code concepts
- Configuration management
- Security-first design
- Documentation alongside code
- Reproducible environments

## üìà Real-World Applications

This infrastructure pattern applies to:

**Development Teams**:
- Remote pair programming
- Monitoring CI/CD pipelines
- Managing cloud deployments
- Operating distributed systems

**AI/ML Workflows**:
- Training long-running models
- Monitoring inference services
- Managing GPU workloads
- Observing agent-based systems

**Personal Projects**:
- Home lab management
- Media servers (Plex, Jellyfin)
- Home automation systems
- Personal cloud storage

**Enterprise Use Cases**:
- Jump boxes/bastion hosts
- Development environment access
- Remote debugging
- Service monitoring dashboards

## üîí Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Network Layer**
   - Tailscale VPN (WireGuard encryption)
   - No public port exposure
   - Device authentication required
   - Automatic key rotation

2. **Authentication Layer**
   - SSH public key authentication
   - Disabled password authentication (after setup)
   - Per-device key pairs
   - No root login permitted

3. **Application Layer**
   - User-level process isolation
   - Minimal service exposure
   - Optional basic auth on ttyd
   - Session timeout configuration

4. **Operational Security**
   - Comprehensive .gitignore for secrets
   - Template configs with placeholders
   - Clear documentation of sensitive data
   - Principle of least privilege

### Security Trade-offs

**Decision**: Use Tailscale instead of public SSH
- **Pro**: Zero attack surface from internet
- **Pro**: Automatic encryption
- **Pro**: Device-level authentication
- **Con**: Dependency on Tailscale service
- **Con**: Additional software requirement

**Decision**: Enable password auth initially
- **Pro**: Easier initial setup
- **Pro**: Recovery option if keys lost
- **Con**: Potential brute force target
- **Mitigation**: Tailscale prevents public access

## üìä Metrics & Performance

### Connection Latency
- Tailscale adds ~5-20ms overhead
- SSH overhead: ~10-30ms
- ttyd adds ~50-100ms for rendering
- Total: Acceptable for human interaction (<200ms typical)

### Resource Usage (Mac mini)
- tmux: ~5-10MB RAM per session
- ttyd: ~10-20MB RAM per instance
- SSH daemon: ~5MB RAM
- Tailscale: ~30-50MB RAM
- **Total overhead**: <100MB for full stack

### Reliability
- tmux: Sessions survive disconnections, system sleeps
- Tailscale: Auto-reconnects on network changes
- Launch agents: Auto-restart on failure
- Overall uptime: Limited only by hardware

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Add tmux-resurrect for session persistence across reboots
- [ ] Implement systemd-style service dependencies
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated backups of tmux sessions
- [ ] Add webhook notifications for task completion
- [ ] Create mobile-optimized web dashboard
- [ ] Implement clipboard sync between devices

### Scalability Options
- Multiple Mac minis in a cluster
- Load balancing across machines
- Shared storage for projects (NFS/Samba)
- Centralized logging (rsyslog, Loki)
- Container orchestration (Docker Swarm, K3s)
